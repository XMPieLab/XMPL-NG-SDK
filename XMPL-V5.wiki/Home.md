XMPL technology is part of the XMPie OpenXM technology stack which includes XMPL HTML, XMPL JavaScript and the XMPL Rest API. 

The **main benefit of XMPL V5** is that this library can work in any Javascript library including Angular and React.

XMPL V5 works with XMPL server V3.3 and later. However, XMPL V3.5 is currently the latest and recommended version. Please contact [XMPie Support](mailto:support@xmpie.com) to upgrade if you are on an earlier version.

There are slight differences in the syntax of the new XMPL library. Since the new library works with modern technologies, you will benefit by creating your new websites using XMPL V5. For existing websites, we created a Syntax Converter which is helpful for adapting to the new library. The Syntax Converter simply replaces the syntax part. Full conversion and website testing are required by the web developer.  

If you are familiar with XMPL V3, see the [[XMPL Syntax Converter]] or consult the [[Cheat Sheet for Web (V5)]]. Otherwise, read on.

XMPL is a JavaScript library that adds personalization to your HTML page. Use the library's custom tags and attributes to add features, such as variable text and images. Show or hide various areas of the page based on the offer that you wish to make for the target recipient. Change the font, color, or any other style aspects with style variables.

Additional features that the library supports include:

* Update recipient data through update forms
* Add new recipients to your database via registration and referral forms
* Update data based on recipient behavior (coming soon)
* Use XMPie's tracking infrastructure through tracking tags


The library communicates with the XMPie campaign via an XMPL server. The server defines a collection of REST services for the library that you can use independently if you wish to perform custom or client-side activity without involving the XMPie client library. This SDK also includes information about these REST services.
